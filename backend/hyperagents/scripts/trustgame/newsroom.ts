The reporter can choose to give you a portion of this money (N dollars) based on their <Allocation> decision. If they do so, you will receive a total value of 3N dollars (N USDC + 2N DHAO tokens).
After receiving this allocation, you can decide how much DHAO to give back to the reporter.
You can return any amount between 0 and 2N DHAO tokens (the maximum possible).

- If you give back DHAO tokens:
For example, if you receive 20 USDC + 40 DHAO (total value: 60 dollars), and you decide to give back 40 dollars worth of DHAO, you will keep only the 20 USDC.

- If you choose not to give any DHAO back: You will keep the full 3N dollars worth (N USDC + 2N DHAO).
For example, with an allocation of 20 dollars, you would keep 20 USDC + 40 DHAO (total value: 60 dollars).

Please provide a short reason explaining your decision.

Your response should follow one of these formats:
